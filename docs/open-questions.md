# Open Questions

Open Questions:
1. How are we measuring success in alpha? aka let's not just put down our head and say this is our roadmap. What do we want to measure that will derive we should keep going forward with our assumptions?
2. Where if any should we have CTA? That's not commmon in documentation but I also don't want to not do it because others don't :)
