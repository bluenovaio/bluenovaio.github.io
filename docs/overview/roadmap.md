# Roadmap
Acceptance Criteria:
- MUST describe our roadmap. see below for what I mean
- MUST keep it high-level and focus on the value prop

Roadmap:
1. alpha --> OSS Testing Framework + Basic Auto-Generation (September). Closed to select few.
2. beta v1 --> Cloud + Preview Environments (December). Closed to select few, but willing to accept more than alpha.
3. beta v2 --> Cloud Advanced Auto-Generation (March 2022)
4. beta v3 --> Cloud Basic Self-Healing (June 2022)
5. MVP --> Advanced Self-Healing (September 2022)

***imo we should be able to raise around beta v2/v3 as that's when we will have validation and good revenue
