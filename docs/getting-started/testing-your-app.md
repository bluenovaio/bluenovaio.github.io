# How To Test Your App

Acceptance Criteria:
1. MUST have Instructions on how to run tests now that they are generated
2. MUST have Instructions on how to debug tests (should this be a section on itself??)
3. MUST have Instructions on how to integrate these tests into your workflow (I don't think we are going to suggest CI out of the box so we should at least be prescriptive here on how they should integrate this into their development process for this first version.)
4. SHOULD include a video of us doing this ourselves
